                    <p>
                        With Brazil being such a large country, it's climate
                        varies considerably from north to south. That being
                        said, 60% of it's land mass lies within a tropical
                        climate, meaning some toasty temperatures and lots of
                        rainfall year round.

                    <h3 className="subtitle">What to Wear:</h3>
                    <p>
                        With Brazil's warm temperatures, you should definitely
                        bring light clothes, both in color and fabric. In
                        Brazil, when it rains it pours! So make sure to bring
                        rainproof clothing and a few ponchos while you're at it.
                        The sun is bright here, so make sure to pack at least
                        one pair of shades and a wide-brimmed hat. Visiting the
                        jungle or rainforest? It'd be a good idea to wear long
                        cotton clothing to protect yourself from critter bites.

                    <p>
                        Considering the size of the US, it's no surprise that
                        it's home to a wide range of climates depending on where
                        you visit. In general, the winters are cold and the
                        summers are hot, but there are a few extremes and
                        exceptions. For instance, Florida, the nation's
                        southernmost state off the coast, has more of a tropical
                        climate.

                    <p>
                        You may actually want to bring a wide variety of
                        clothing to tour across America. Generally, in the
                        Summer, you'll want to bring short sleeves, shorts, and
                        maybe a wide-brimmed hat or two to block out the sun. In
                        states like Texas and California, temperatures can reach
                        over 100 degrees fahrenheit! While most stays relatively
                        cool during the Winter, northern states such as New York
                        and Michigan may get several inches of snow and even
                        experience blizzards. Make sure you bring your winter
                        jacket!

                            Unless you've been living under a rock, you've
                            definitely heard of the Magic Kingdom!
                            Interestingly, the Magic Kingdom is only one theme
                            park in the multitude of parks available to visit at
                            Disney World! These parks include Epcot, Hollywood
                            Studios, Animal Kingdom, and the Blizzard Beach
                            Water Park. It would be a crime to visit the US and
                            not go to the Happiest Place on Earth!

                        <p>
                            In the capital of the U.S. lies one of the most
                            important structures in the country; The White
                            House! This building is both the residence and
                            office of the President of the United States. You
                            will also find museums and memorials nearby, such as
                            the Washington, Lincoln, and Martin Luther King Jr.
                            Memorials.

                            Vegas, Nevada, as the name would suggest. Remember:
